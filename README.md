this is the first task using code 
i used intellij IDE , I had to use something called maven it's like a library has a default code inside i started getting from internet the dependencied i need like selenuim which in significant for 
locating the chrome driver i already downlowded . 
in the main i wrote a sequential code and put the file path of the driver in it's place 
moreover I specified the website to enter to be anything i want 
note that : driver.quit(); makes the browser closed after a while 
in general this is simple task
