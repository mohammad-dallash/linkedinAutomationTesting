this task is similar to open browser rep
i just changed the page to linkedin and create a test class ( what i should run in this case )
and a main/java/package/class that has the web elements and actions 
the maven (pom.xml ) still the same cuz the deeded dependancy ( selenium) is already exist from task 1
